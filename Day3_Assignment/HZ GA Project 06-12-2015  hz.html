				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I'm an entrepreneur, a West Coast Swing/Hustle dancer, and an efficiency nut.  I'm a purveyor of excellent (terrible) jokes and puns, and a Learner of Things.  
				I love good New York chinese food, sun, and my altogether-too-smart dog, Monty.
				I'm a huge fan of sci-fi novels.
				I'm a father of an altogether-too-smart daughter who beat me to the goal of becoming a software engineer.  I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
				I'm that guy who just HAS to know how _____ works.  Just give me 1 more minute to poke at it...
				I'm the dashing bloke you see in this entirely un-ironic photo.
